# Danted
**Installation and configuration guide for dante - a free socks server**

## Installation
In ubuntu, we can install dante-server with ```$ sudo apt install dante-server```.
For my case, I installed version 1.4.2.

In debian or centos, we can try [a fast script](https://github.com/lozy/danted) 
for installation and configuration. **Note:** Unfortunately, this script fails in 
my ubuntu 18.04 and I did NOT test it in debian or centos.

## Confuguration
Revise danted.conf (/etc/danted.conf) like the following
```
logoutput: /var/log/danted.log
# internal: dante-server will accept connections going to this address
# use the virtual address assigned to your proxy server (for me, it's the ubuntu 18.04 workstation)
internal: 10.11.12.10 port = 2019
# external: all outgoing connections will use this network interface
# i.e. the network interface you used to view websites in your proxy server
external: eno1
method: username none
user.privileged: sockd
user.notprivileged: nobody
user.libwrap: nobody
client pass {
# only allow client with address 10.11.12.13
from: 10.11.12.13/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
log: connect disconnect
}
pass {
from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0 port gt 1023
command: bind
log: connect disconnect
}
pass {
from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
command: connect udpassociate
log: connect disconnect
}
block {
from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
log: connect error
}
```

## Run
```bash
sudo systemctl start danted
```
In client machine (10.11.12.13), visit websites with Chrome and SwitchyOmega 
(set proxy server to 10.11.12.10 with port 2019).
